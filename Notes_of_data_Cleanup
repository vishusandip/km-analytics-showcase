1. Created numerical variable for the price of the purchased vehicle. Did the calculation of midpoint of the range. e.g. 0 to 15000 is converted to 0+15000/2 = 7500
2. Repeated #1 for appraisal_offer
3. Strategy for NULL value replacement of online_appraisal_flag, 146,546 rows out of 200,000 have value of 0, 49620 have value of 1 and 3834 are null. So replacing all null valus with 0 as it is the most repeated value.
